I like building features that give you, the beloved customer, the power to customize Buttondown as you see fit.

Generally these are _happy_ features: better analytics, smart scheduling, that sort of thing.

Sometimes, though, people unsubscribe. Buttondown gives them a curt and plain exit survey asking them why they unsubscribed, but you can now override that default with a link of your choice.

Personally, I'm a little bitter whenever someone unsubscribes, and I _want them to know_ that I take it personally. So I've overwritten my unsubscription URL to something a little special:
