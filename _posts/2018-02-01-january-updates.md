<p>Howdy and Happy New Year!  We had a quiet but productive start to 2018; I'm pumped to share what we've been up to.</p>
<h3 id="linkanalytics">Link analytics</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/i6vd6Dl.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can now gain insight into exactly what links folks are clicking on and reading!</p>
<h3 id="embeddedtweets">Embedded tweets</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/tiqkhdi.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can now paste Tweet URLs and they'll automatically get converted into embedded tweets, saving you time and energy.</p>
<h3 id="nicerscheduling">Nicer scheduling</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/cK9O2wz.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The scheduling mechanism has been replaced with something a little less janky and confusing.  (Everyone hated UTC.  Myself included.)</p>
<h3 id="onnextweeksepisode">On next week's episode...</h3>
<p>My product roadmap is, as ever, prone to flights of fancy, but here's what's on the docket for February:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continuing to refine and improve tweet embedding.  (It handles embedded links sort of oddly, amongst other things.)</li>
<li>Getting the API ready for public consumption.  (If you have strong feelings on this, <a href="mailto:justin@buttondown.email">let me know</a>!)</li>
<li>A stand-alone analytics page.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="spreadtheword">Spread the word!</h3>
<p>If you've enjoyed using Buttondown, <a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Buttondown%20is%20the%20best%20way%20to%20start%20and%20grow%20your%20newsletter%3A%20https%3A//buttondown.email">share it</a> with a friend! More people using Buttondown means more time and energy I can justify working on it.</p>
