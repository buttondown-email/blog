<p>Hey there! March has had a bunch of stuff arrive in the ol' Buttondown codebase, mostly on the smaller side of things.  Here's the quick laundry list:</p>
<h3 id="sortyoursubscribers">Sort your subscribers</h3>
<p>Coming shortly after publishing this â€” sorting by tags, as well!</p>
<h3 id="redesignedarchivepages">Redesigned archive pages</h3>
<p>Easier on the eyes.  (No changes to the actual emails being sent.)</p>
<h3 id="streamlinedbillingflow">Streamlined billing flow</h3>
<p>Okay, yeah, you might not be too excited about this, but it's a big deal I promise.</p>
<h3 id="publicapilaunch">Public API launch</h3>
<p>Still in the process of baking out more documentation, but it's live! If you're curious about this, feel free to <a href="mailto:justin@buttondown.email">email</a> me.</p>
<h3 id="upcomingupdates">Upcoming updates</h3>
<p>My product roadmap is, as ever, prone to flights of fancy, but here's what's on the docket for April:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding an FAQ page (or knowledge base or whatever we want to call the whole idea of enshrining knowledge someplace that is publicly accessible.)</li>
<li>Nicer display of code in emails and archives.</li>
<li>Some boring technical debt stuff.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="agifforyourtroubles">A gif for your troubles</h3>
