<p>Creating or iterating through your Buttondown drafts is now <em>even easier</em> (well, if you're the type of person who thinks <code>cURL</code> and <a href="https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/">Requests</a> is easy — at which point, like, don't worry, you're amongst friends.)</p><p><strong>Drafts</strong>, of course, are emails that you're still working on or tinkering with, or things that you might want to flesh out later without commiting to an actual send.  You can access them through the API and, of course, through the <a href="https://buttondown.email/emails/drafts">Drafts</a> page.<p>Because drafts are now accessible via the API, they're <em>also</em> accessible via Buttondown's<em> </em><a href="https://zapier.com/app/login?next=/developer/public-invite/10328/3f461ccf51be6e2e3f356c7365434907/">Zapier integration</a>, which is of course free and publicly available to use.</p>
