Squarespace is a great tool that makes it easy to create beautiful websites.  You can enhance your Squarespace site by connecting it with Buttondown â€” making it easy for site visitors to sign up for updates to your newsletter.

### Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you have a:

1.  live and working Squarespace site with a page that's ready for adding a new [content block](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/206543757-About-blocks)
2.  Buttondown account.  If you don't have one, you can [sign up here!](https://buttondown.email/register)

### Getting your share form

First, head on over to your [Share page](https://buttondown.email/share#form) and click **as a form**.  You should see a code snippet that's captioned with **Your buttondown subscribe form**:

This is the HTML snippet that we'll be bringing into Squarespace.

### Adding it to Squarespace

Head over to the Squarespace page you're looking to add your Buttondown form to and create a *content block*.  You should see a menu like this pop up:

Next, hit the Gray code icon that looks like `</>` to the right of the text box.
