For a long time (as in, up until today), Buttondown could only charge in dollars for
paid newsletters. This is no longer the case!

I'm honestly not sure what else to write here. The code change was pretty boring (thanks, Stripe!). This
was long overdue; the number of newsletters outside America outnumber the number of newsletters inside America.
I'm happy I was able to make the change.

If you haven't set up a paid newsletter and you're interested in doing so, it's
as painless as starting a business on the internet could be! Just go over to your [Paid subscriptions page](https://buttondown.email/settings/paid-subscriptions) and check it out!

(If you're interested in charging in a currency that isn't currently listed in the page, [shoot me an email](mailto:justin@buttondown.email)
and I'll get it added for you!)
