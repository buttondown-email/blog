<p>Do you have multiple newsletters?  Or have you <em>thought</em> about starting a second newsletter, but it sounded like a massive pain that just would not be very fun at all?</p><p>Boy, do I have some news for you.</p><p>We've got <em><strong>support for multiple newsletters</strong></em>.  Instead of logging out and back in every time you want to switch things, it's accessible from a handy little dropdown in the top-right corner of the screen (the same way you get to, say, <em>Settings</em>) and in comes a handy lil modal letting you choose:</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="/content/images/2019/06/D78kia7VUAAAGn4.jpg-large.jpeg" class="kg-image"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>It's still in a little bit of a janky phase — for instance, I haven't built out a UI to <em>add </em>multiple newsletters, so I need to do it manually — but if you're interested in it <a href="mailto:justin@buttondown.email">send me an email</a>.  So far there are a couple dozen folks using it and loving it — you should join us!</p>
