<p>We've offered analytics for your emails for a while now, which is great: it's awesome to see what emails are really resonating with your subscribers and which ones, uh, aren't.</p>
<p>But often it's important to get even more introspection into how folks interact with your emails.  We want you to be able to use Buttondown to answer questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do people click on links about Python more than they click on links about software development as a whole?</li>
<li>Who keeps my emails kicking around in their inbox for weeks before finally diving in?</li>
<li>Which of my subscribers are forwarding my emails to friends and colleagues?</li>
</ul>
<p>Today we're launching the first step of that: <em>subscriber events</em>.  Now you can see exactly how a given subscriber interacts with your emails over time: when they open them, what they click on, and so on.</p>
<p>This is the first step in a series of changes we're planning for revamping Buttondown's analytics, and its something we're super excited about.</p>
<p>As always, if you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to <a href="mailto:justin@buttondown.email">email me</a>!</p>
