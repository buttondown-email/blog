<p>(I'm going to try really hard to not make some sort of <em>doing it for the 'gram</em> reference in this post.)</p><p>((Well, I guess I just upped and did it, huh?))</p><p>Okay.  Just like how you can embed tweets or gists into your email by dropping in a URL, you can now do the same thing with Instagram!</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="/img/uploads/screen-shot-2019-07-30-at-8.41.42-pm.png" class="kg-image"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>You don't need to enable anything or connect anything.  Just drop in a URL and, like everything (okay, <em>most things</em>) in Buttondown, it <em>just works</em>.  (The best part is that it's all HTML and CSS — no Javascript! — meaning that it works great in every single email client, and you don't have to worry about lazy loading or fallbacks or <code>noscript</code>.)</p><p>Interested in embedding anything else easily?  <a href="mailto:justin@buttondown.email">Let me know</a>.</p>
