You can create a subscription form in Webflow and connect it to your Buttondown newsletter to gather email addresses and segment them in two easy steps:

1. **Grabbing your subscription URL** from Buttondown
2. **Configuring your Webflow form** to forward emails to Buttondown

### Requirements

1. If you haven't already, [create a Buttondown account](https://buttondown.email/register). It's easy and only takes two minutes.
2. Ensure you have a [form](https://university.webflow.com/article/intro-to-forms) on your Webflow page.
3. Ensure there's at least one **input field** on your form (set to required) with the name set to `email` and the `text type` set to email, like the below:
