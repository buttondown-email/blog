<p>You probably know that by going to your <a href="https://buttondown.email/share">Share</a> page, you can access all sorts of ways to collect subscribers: via a simple link, via an iFrame, and via an HTML <code>form</code> tag.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="/img/ss1.png" class="kg-image"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>That form tag is pretty powerful and lets you customize your new subscriber flow in a whole bunch of ways.  A particularly useful one that you may be unaware of: <strong>you can specify what tags the subscriber should be enrolled in</strong>!  </p><p>The TL;DR of this is that the form endpoint where you send subscribers —<code>https://buttondown.email/api/emails/embed-subscribe/&lt;your-username&gt;</code>  — takes a <code>POST</code> parameter, <code>tag</code>, which accepts a list of strings and maps those strings to tags for your new subscriber.</p><p>Here are a couple scenarios where this may come in handy:</p><h3 id="using-a-hidden-input-to-tag-subscribers">Using a <em>hidden</em> input to tag subscribers</h3><p>Let's say you're running a programming blog.  You write about two main subjects — Python, and data visualization — and at the end of your posts you have a little subscribe widget that allows interested readers to sign up for your newsletter. </p><p>You want to keep track of which subscribers are coming from which type of post, because Python esoterica may not be interesting to data viz nerds and vice versa.</p><p>All you'd need to do is, within your HTML form tag, include the following line:</p>{% highlight html %}<input type="hidden" name="tag" value="python" />{% endhighlight %}<h3 id="allowing-folks-to-self-select-their-tags">Allowing folks to self-select their tags</h3><p>Maybe, though, you want to give your readers a higher level of freedom, and let them <em>choose their own adventure</em>.  Using basic HTML form primitives, you can do exactly that!  For example, you could let them choose between a tag (say, <em>friend</em> or <em>foe):</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: embed--><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe id="cp_embed_eqOwzZ" src="https://codepen.io/jmduke/embed/preview/eqOwzZ?height=300&amp;slug-hash=eqOwzZ&amp;default-tabs=html,result&amp;host=https://codepen.io" title="" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="300" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width: 100%; overflow: hidden;"></iframe></figure><!--kg-card-end: embed--><p>Or let them select as many as they want:</p><!--kg-card-begin: embed--><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe id="cp_embed_RXbzRJ" src="https://codepen.io/jmduke/embed/preview/RXbzRJ?height=300&amp;slug-hash=RXbzRJ&amp;default-tabs=html,result&amp;host=https://codepen.io" title="Tag self-enrollment in Buttondown" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="300" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width: 100%; overflow: hidden;"></iframe></figure><!--kg-card-end: embed--><p>These two examples are trivial, but you get the idea!  Tagging is a pretty powerful concept and it's <em>really</em> easy to set up in an automatic fashion.</p>
