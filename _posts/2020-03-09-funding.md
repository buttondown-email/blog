title: Buttondown's funding of open source software

Software sits on the shoulders of giants.

Buttondown is a tool that simply would not exist without the gargantuan effort of many, many open-source projects, the vast majority of which are drastically underfunded relative to the value they provide.

I've committed to donating at least 20% of Buttondown's profits to the software that enables it. This is a relatively low number in absolute terms — I'm certainly not changing anyone's life — but I think it's still important.

I've finally pulled together a document for tracking Buttondown's public donations, and you can follow it at [docs.buttondown.email](https://docs.buttondown.email).

(I haven't pulled it server-side, like I did with my [running costs](https://docs.buttondown.email), because I anticipate the data being much more boring. But if that changes in the future, I'll certainly re-evaluate!)
