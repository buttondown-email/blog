<p>Tags are great on their own, but there's no fun segmenting your subscribers if you can't actually do anything with those segments, right?</p>
<p>Well, um.  Now there <em>is</em> something you can do with them.  And it's exactly what you'd expect!  In a good way.  If you have tags, you can now send a newsletter to a specific tag (or list of tags).</p>
