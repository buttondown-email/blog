<p>Listen, I love Markdown.  It's 50% of the reason why I started Buttondown: I wanted to be able to draft emails easily with as little markup as possible.</p>
<p>But not everyone does!  It's weird, and if you're not technical you probably haven't had too much exposure to it.</p>
<p>Which is why I'm happy to announce one of the most heavily requested features of all time: a <strong>simple, elegant toolbar</strong> to assist with marking up your email if you're not comfortable with writing Markdown by hand.</p>
<p>It pops right up, just hit the ol' &quot;Show toolbar&quot; toggle and feast your eyes!</p>
