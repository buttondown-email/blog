[Plausible](https://plausible.io/) is a simple, privacy-friendly alternative to Google Analytics. It's fully compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and PECR, and offers *no cookie use whatsoever*. It's a great way to learn more about your site and your subscribers & visitors while respecting their privacy.

I've been a huge fan of what Plausible has been doing, and I'm excited to partner with them and integrate our two services: their ethos is _very_ well-aligned with Buttondown's.

Integrating with your **Plausible Analytics** account is simple and takes all of five minutes! You can integrate with your newsletter and track viewers of your archives, plus see what visitors are clicking on the most and which of your archive pages are most effective at getting folks to subscribe.

You can read more about how to do so [here](https://www.notion.so/Plausible-92963063561840709c7571c7ec8db261)!

Thanks for reading, and as always [let me know](mailto:justin@buttondown.email) if you have any questions!
