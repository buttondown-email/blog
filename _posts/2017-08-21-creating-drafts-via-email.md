<p>One of our most-requested features is the ability to send an email and have it transform into a draft.</p>
<p>That's now a thing!</p>
<p>You can go to your <a href="https://buttondown.email/emails/drafts/">drafts page</a> to find your personal email address: send something there and the subject + body of the email are automatically converted into the draft.  This can be super handy if you want to jot down some thoughts on the go!</p>
