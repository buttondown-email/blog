title: Why Buttondown funds open source
---

> The world runs on open source. For decades, both integrators and end users have enjoyed the benefits of open source work without considering the cost of labor necessary to build and maintain the infrastructure on which our modern world operates.

Currently, Buttondown is spending **$150/mo** on giving back to the software community that has enabled it.  This is broken down as such:

- **$50** to the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/donations/)
- **$50** to the [Django Software Foundation](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/)
- **$50** to [Django Rest Framework](https://fund.django-rest-framework.org/topics/funding/)
