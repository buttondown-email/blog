I am particularly excited to share that I am now forwarded some traffic through the EU.  You may be wondering: *uh, why?*

Well, for starters, this means you can make sure your customer data and emails are processed without leaving the EU.  There's increasing complexity in how to manage data, and also a healthy dose of better-safe-than-sorryism.

Plus, location matters. EU-borne emails are going to be faster and have better inbox placement rates than US-borne emails if the majority of your subscribers are European.

I haven't exposed this as a setting yet in Buttondown (it is not obvious to me that I _ever_ will, since it seems like a niche request), but if you're interested, please [email me](mailto:justin@buttondown.email) and I'll flag you in!
