<p>Previously, Buttondown's changes were in the form of a <a href="http://changelog.buttondown.email">changelog</a>, hosted generously by the fine folks over at <a href="http://headwayapp.co">Headway</a>.</p>
<p>Headway is great, but as Buttondown matures there's a lot more content and writing that needs to develop around it, stuff like:</p>
<ol>
<li>API documentation</li>
<li>a knowledge base</li>
<li>content marketing</li>
</ol>
<p>This stuff requires a level of sophistication (or, if not sophistication, etymological complexity) that connotes my favorite three-letter word: CMS.</p>
<p>Choosing a CMS these days is just as fraught and hairy of a decision as choosing a tech stack (hell, it <em>is</em> choosing a tech stack), and I batted around a number of options:</p>
<ol>
<li>I love static site generators, but I wanted an easier deployment process than what they offer.  Specifically, I wanted an admin interface that made drafting and publishing easy (especially when I'm away from my laptop.)</li>
<li>I looked at <a href="https://craftcms.com/">Craft</a>, which had a lot of praise from friends and peers, but the hosting story seemed murky and developing a theme locally seemed painful (I do not want to have to run MySQL just to write some templates!)</li>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a> is, as always, an elephant in every room: but I didn't think I needed the complex ecosystem behind it and wasn't thrilled about the concept of writing PHP.</li>
</ol>
<p>Meanwhile, I've had <a href="http://ghost.org">Ghost</a> bookmarked for ages.  It offers a lot of great quality-of-life stuff out of the gate:</p>
<ol>
<li>A beautiful admin interface (as seen above).</li>
<li>Built-in support for <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars</a>, a great and functional templating interface</li>
<li>A <a href="https://ghost.org/pricing/">reasonably priced</a> managed hosting offering.</li>
</ol>
<p>And so, yeah! Buttondown's blog runs on Ghost. I'm excited to explore Ghost's ecosystem more — it's been a delight to work with thus far — and as always, feel free to email <a href="mailto:justin@buttondown.email">me</a> if you have any questions about the platform.</p>
