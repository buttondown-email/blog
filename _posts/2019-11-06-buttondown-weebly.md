[Weebly](https://www.weebly.com/) is a great tool by Square that makes it free and easy to build out a website
for your business.

Getting a Buttondown form onto Weebly is as quick and easy as everything else.

First, go to your [share page](https://buttondown.email/settings) and copy the HTML code under **Your Buttondown subscribe form**:

Next, go into your Weebly editor and add a "Custom Embed" widget. You should get an input popping up that
says "Edit Custom HTML":
