<p>I'll be honest.  I <em>hate</em> learning about unsubscribed folks.  It stresses me out.</p>
<p>But many of you do not feel that way, and want a way to keep track of folks who have unsubscribed from your newsletter.  I've been meaning to surface this information for a while, and now Buttondown offers a <a href="https://buttondown.email/subscribers/unsubscribers">unsubscribers page</a> so you can learn more about folks who have moved on to greener pastures.</p>
<p>(Unsubscribers are prompted for the reason why they unsubscribed.  If they fill it out, that information will be surfaced here as well!)</p>
<p>If you're especially masochistic, I've also added a setting sending you email notifications whenever someone unsubscribes.  It is <em>rife</em> with sad gifs.</p>

<p>Hope you find this useful!  Or, if you are terrified by the possibility of rejection, then just ignore it.  Either one is completely rational to me.</p>
