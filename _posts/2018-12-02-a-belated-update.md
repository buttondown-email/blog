<p>Hello!  How are you doing? That scarf looks great on you.</p>
<p>It’s been a while since I’ve checked in.  That’s for a couple reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It has been a particularly hectic summer.</li>
<li>And, I suppose, a particularly hectic autumn.</li>
<li>Heck, the winter's been pretty busy too.</li>
<li>Buttondown’s been growing — like, a lot — which means there have been more operational demands that keep me from building features and writing lovely monthly missives to you all.</li>
<li>Writing is, like, <em>difficult</em>, and sometimes I am very lazy.</li>
</ol>
<p>And, so, yeah — on the surface, not much has changed over the past six months.  Below the surface, though, there have been lots of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lots of “performance improvements and bug fixes”, to use the App Store parlance.  There are slow endpoints and finicky modals that are slightly less slow and slightly less finicky now.</li>
<li>Operational scaling; figuring out how to scale my customer support to make sure folks get responses and help quickly and effectively.</li>
<li>Some infrastructural changes, including a new customer enrichment provider and a better queuing mechanism.</li>
</ul>
<p>But as I send this out, it is December, and the Seattle air is suffused with a certain crispness and calm that steers a young man’s thoughts towards feature development.  I’m excited to keep working in earnest on stuff that makes Buttondown, you know, better, in the new year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email templating</li>
<li>SoundCloud, Instagram, and CodePen embeds.</li>
<li>A better way to view your upcoming scheduled emails</li>
<li>Suggested schedule times.</li>
<li>Zapier support.</li>
<li>Multiple newsletters for a single user.</li>
<li>Integration with Google Analytics.</li>
<li>The finishing touches on paid subscriptions (sorry to those of you who have been pining for this! Just want to make sure it’s really, <em>really</em> polished.)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is going to sound hackneyed, but it is a blessing and a joy to work on Buttondown.  Y’all are the best.</p>
<p>(And, as always, if you ever have any questions, concerns, or suggestions — <a href="mailto:justin@buttondown.email">shoot me an email</a>!</p>
<p>(And I promise, the monthly updates will come back in 2019.  I missed them.)</p>
