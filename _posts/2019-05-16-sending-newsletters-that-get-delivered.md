<p>This blog post will help you with the most important thing you care about if you're writing and sending a newsletter: <strong>making sure your newsletter ends up in your subscribers' inboxes, and not in the Spam folder</strong>.  If your newsletter isn't doing this, then no brilliant writing or incredible tactics matters — it's all going to waste.</p><p>So let's talk about the most important step in doing this: <strong>verifying your domain</strong>!</p><p>The biggest part of making sure your newsletter gets delivered is by making sure <strong>you're</strong><em> </em>the one sending it; that, as far as your email address is concerned, you are who you say you are.  </p><p>You see, spammers and malicious actors like to impersonate others (specifically, their email addresses) in order to trick folks into giving personal information or misreading an email — in order to solve this, email hosts like Gmail and Yahoo have developed the concepts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail">DKIM</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework">SPF</a> records, which are sort of optional drivers' licenses for emails: they sit on your domain and verify that you're giving your newsletter application the right to send emails on your behalf.</p><p>SPF and DKIM have gotten so prevalent, and so important, that Gmail now only shares images from domains that have valid SPF and DKIM messages:</p><blockquote> And we only display images by default for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-mail_authentication">authenticated</a> messages (using SPF or DKIM).</blockquote><p>It's important to choose a newsletter provider that lets you send your emails through SPF and DKIM.  Thankfully, with Buttondown it's easy:</p><ul><li>Signup for a <a href="http://buttondown.email/signup">free account</a>, if you don't already have one.</li><li>Next, navigate to your <a href="https://buttondown.email/settings">settings</a> page and put in your desired domain into the "custom domain" setting:</li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="/content/images/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-16-at-11.59.30-AM.png" class="kg-image"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><ul><li>Go to your DNS provider of choice and input the requested records.</li><li>Go back to your settings page and verify that the records are set up correctly (it can take some time for them to propagate)</li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="/content/images/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-16-at-12.01.20-PM.png" class="kg-image"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>That's it!  It should only take a couple minutes for you to get <strong>trustworthy, high-deliverability emails that end up in your subscribers' inboxes.</strong></p>
