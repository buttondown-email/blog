<p>Welcome to May! I wrote this from two places:</p><ol><li>the lounge of Seattle’s Sorrento Hotel, counting down the minutes until Silent Reading Party (a truly insufferable city tradition that I love dearly) begins;</li><li>the promenade of Cal Anderson Park, on a particularly sunny Saturday.</li></ol><p>I wrote last month that April was going to be filled with small and necessary work, a nice step back before diving into some renewed projects.  It was exactly that!</p><p>Buttondown has been <em>buggy</em> the past few months.  It feels bad to admit that, but it's true; the "bugs" tag in my issue tracker has been growing wider and more bulbous, and it feels good (and, frankly, necessary) to dedicate some time tackling it.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="/content/images/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-04-at-6.05.28-PM-1.png" class="kg-image"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Still, I was able to get <em>some</em> fun stuff done:</p><h1 id="email-domains-for-all">Email domains for all</h1><p>I announced last month that I had added support for custom SPIF/DKM records for premium accounts, and I'm <em>thrilled</em> to announce that it's now available for <em>everyone</em>.  If you own your own domain, you can now use it to sign the emails you send from Buttondown, greatly improving deliverability:</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="/content/images/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-04-at-6.03.18-PM.png" class="kg-image"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>There are a couple reasons why I decided to make this a free feature: but it really comes down to one thing: <strong>deliverability is important</strong>, and it feels gross to essentially gate high deliverability behind $29/month.</p><h1 id="utm-sources">UTM sources</h1><p>In what may be the most niche feature ever, you can now <a href="https://www.bluleadz.com/blog/what-are-utm-tags-and-how-to-use-them">automatically apply UTM tags</a> to all outgoing links from your newsletter.</p><h1 id="twitter-support-for-meta-tags">Twitter support for meta tags</h1><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="/content/images/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-04-at-6.04.00-PM.png" class="kg-image"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Sharing your newsletter on Twitter looks prettier!</p><h1 id="what-s-next">What’s next</h1><p>May is going to also be a heavy bug-squash-and-technical-debt month, but with a couple meatier things to handle:</p><ol><li>CAPTCHA support for embedded signup forms.  (Lots of folks have complained about getting spammy subscribers: I hear you, and this should help with that!)</li><li>A nicer writing UI.  (The first major UI change since I launched Buttondown in 2017!)</li></ol><h1 id="oh-and-introducing-weeknotes">Oh, and... introducing Weeknotes</h1><p>I've launched <a href="https://weeknotes.buttondown.email">Weeknotes</a>, a weekly update newsletter for Buttondown.  Weeknotes will be more focused on the minutiae of building Buttondown, rather than feature announcements and updates.  Subscribe to it if:</p><ol><li>You want to learn more about what building Buttondown is like.</li><li>You want to support Buttondown but do not want to pay $29/month for a premium account.  (Weeknotes costs $4/month — think of it as patronage!)</li></ol><p>As such, I'll likely be shifting the blog's structure from monthly updates more towards blog posts for each major feature.  (Of course, I say that now, but who knows what happens five months from now.  I'm nothing if not consistently inconsistent!)</p>
