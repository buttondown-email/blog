Many folks write newsletters with a friend or frequent collaborator.  I write a personal letter, [Letters to J](https://buttondown.email/letters-to-j), with a good friend, for instance, and I would be remiss if I didn't send any more official Buttondown emails without sending a draft to my partner and de facto copyeditor for a second pair of eyes. 

Buttondown now makes this process slightly easier by keeping track of who you've sent drafts to in the past, so you don't have to go through the ever-so-onerous of retyping email addresses each time:

To check out the new flow, click that "Choose draft recipients" button at the right-hand side of your send draft button.  Happy copy-editing!
