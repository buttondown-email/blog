<p>Howdy!</p>
<p>It's a quiet Sunday here in Seattle; the sun hasn't quite imposed its will on the streets and shops yet, and I'm here wrapping up a couple small bugs.  (Er, bug <em>fixes</em>, not bugs.  But probably some bugs too.)</p>
<p>Here's what's new this month!</p>
<h3 id="analytics">Analytics</h3>
<p><img src="/content/images/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-03-at-10.59.11-AM.png" alt="Screen-Shot-2018-06-03-at-10.59.11-AM"></p>
<p>The new <a href="https://buttondown.email/analytics/">analytics page</a> is live!  There are still a few edge cases that are rough around the edges, but I hope you enjoy it (and let me know if there's anything that explodes.)</p>
<h3 id="codehandling">Code handling</h3>
<p><img src="/content/images/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-03-at-11.02.01-AM.png" alt="Screen-Shot-2018-06-03-at-11.02.01-AM"></p>
<p>Code blocks now work, like, <em>way</em> better, as seen above.  (Plus: built-in syntax highlighting!  Check out the <a href="https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/code_hilite/">documentation</a> for more details.)</p>
<h3 id="vimeoembeds">Vimeo embeds</h3>
<p><img src="/content/images/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-03-at-11.03.01-AM.png" alt="Screen-Shot-2018-06-03-at-11.03.01-AM"></p>
<p>Adding a Vimeo video to your email is as easy as dropping in the link, as you see above. (More context: email clients don't support actual videos, so what we're doing here is generating a thumbnail of the video, adding a play button on top, and making it a link to the actual video!)</p>
<h3 id="upcoming">Upcoming</h3>
<p>As always, my product backlog is somewhere between &quot;flux&quot; and &quot;unmitigated&quot; chaos, but here's whats on the docket for June:</p>
<ol>
<li>Launching the beta for <em>paid subscriptions.</em> (Does this sound interesting?  Get in touch.)</li>
<li>Support for newsletter icons.</li>
<li>Sending drafts to folks besides yourself.  (Meant to do this last month.  I got...sidetracked.)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="agifforyourtroubles">A gif for your troubles</h3>
