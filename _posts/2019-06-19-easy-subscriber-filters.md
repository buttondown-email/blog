<p>Here was a fun thing to work on: <em>subscriber filters</em>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="/content/images/2019/06/image.png" class="kg-image"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>This is my favorite brand of Buttondown feature: solve an obvious problem with established interfaces.  As of now, you can answer a handful of important and pertinent questions with a mere two clicks:</p><ol><li><strong>Who has unsubscribed from my newsletter?</strong> (Okay, you could have answered this one for a while, but now it's in a more semantically relevant part of the interface.)</li><li><strong>Who has subscribed to my newsletter that Buttondown has deemed is kinda spammy?</strong> (The obvious followup question to this is: "well if you thought they were spammy, why would you let them subscribe in the first place?", to which the answer is: "we don't, but sometimes you may import a spammy subscriber or an email address reveals itself later to be spammy")</li><li><strong> What subscribers have bounced from my newsletter? </strong>("bounced" is email-speak for "we tried to send them an email and couldn't, so we won't try in the future.")</li><li><strong>Which subscribers haven't opened my emails in a while?</strong> (The cutoff here is fairly arbitrary — three emails — and I might expand it in the future.)</li></ol><p>That's it!  Test it out.  Is there a filter you're dying for that doesn't exist? <a href="mailto:justin@buttondown.email">Send me an email</a> and let me know.</p>
